## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties (BEM)
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Line height may vary between fields, even if nested in the root of a page.

### Continued development

I may change the link href, but other than that it's pretty simple and straight forward. No accessibility remarks to account for.
